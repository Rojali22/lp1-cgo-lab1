# **Code Generation Lab exercise using Granite Code Model**
Use IBM Granite Models for Code Generation and Programming Tasks

## Introduction
In this lab, you’ll use an IBM Granite model to generate Python code for a given scenario. You’ll apply your knowledge of prompting techniques to define and execute prompts to generate code using IBM Granite. 

## Software requirements 
To complete this lab, you’ll need access to a Replicate account, which allows you to use AI models to perform tasks. You’ll also need an API token from your Replicate account. An API token is like a digital key that lets the lab securely connect to your Replicate account. This token will be securely added to your Google Colab environment so the lab can run correctly. While you don’t need to know Python to follow along, familiarity with it may help you better understand the code created during the lab. 

## Objective 
After completing this lab, you should be able to: 

Use IBM Granite models for code generation and programming tasks.
 
## Lab steps 
This lab requires you to complete the following steps: 

- **Step 1: Create a GitHub account**
- **Step 2: Create a Replicate account** 
- **Step 3: Sign up for Google Colab** 
- **Step 4: Load the Jupyter notebook and initialize the model**
- **Step 5: Generate code using the IBM Granite model**

## Estimated duration to complete
